/// Decoding of frames via buffers.
///
/// This trait is used when constructing an instance of [`Framed`] or
/// [`FramedRead`]. An implementation of `Decoder` takes a byte stream that has
/// already been buffered in `src` and decodes the data into a stream of
/// `Self::Item` frames.
///
/// Implementations are able to track state on `self`, which enables
/// implementing stateful streaming parsers. In many cases, though, this type
/// will simply be a unit struct (e.g. `struct HttpDecoder`).
///
/// For some underlying data-sources, namely files and FIFOs,
/// it's possible to temporarily read 0 bytes by reaching EOF.
///
/// In these cases `decode_eof` will be called until it signals
/// fullfillment of all closing frames by returning `Ok(None)`.
/// After that, repeated attempts to read from the [`Framed`] or [`FramedRead`]
/// will not invoke `decode` or `decode_eof` again, until data can be read
/// during a retry.
///
/// It is up to the Decoder to keep track of a restart after an EOF,
/// and to decide how to handle such an event by, for example,
/// allowing frames to cross EOF boundaries, re-emitting opening frames, or
/// resetting the entire internal state.
///

    /// interfering with the processing of future messages, it may be more
    /// useful to report the failure as an `Item`.
    ///
    /// `From<io::Error>` is required in the interest of making `Error` suitable
    /// for returning directly from a [`FramedRead`], and to enable the default
    /// implementation of `decode_eof` to yield an `io::Error` when the decoder
    /// fails to consume all available data.
    ///

    /// Attempts to decode a frame from the provided buffer of bytes.
    ///
    /// This method is called by [`FramedRead`] whenever bytes are ready to be
    /// parsed. The provided buffer of bytes is what's been read so far, and
    /// this instance of `Decode` can determine whether an entire frame is in
    /// the buffer and is ready to be returned.
    ///
    /// If an entire frame is available, then this instance will remove those
    /// bytes from the buffer provided and return them as a decoded
    /// frame. Note that removing bytes from the provided buffer doesn't always
    /// necessarily copy the bytes, so this should be an efficient operation in
    /// most circumstances.
    ///
    /// If the bytes look valid, but a frame isn't fully available yet, then
    /// `Ok(None)` is returned. This indicates to the [`Framed`] instance that
    /// it needs to read some more bytes before calling this method again.
    ///
    /// Note that the bytes provided may be empty. If a previous call to
    /// `decode` consumed all the bytes in the buffer then `decode` will be
    /// called again until it returns `Ok(None)`, indicating that more bytes need to
    /// be read.
    ///
    /// Finally, if the bytes in the buffer are malformed then an error is
    /// returned indicating why. This informs [`Framed`] that the stream is now
    /// corrupt and should be terminated.
